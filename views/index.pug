      This website is basically my web development sandbox. I make no
      guarantees on how often new stuff will be added, but anytime I
      create something I find cool or useful, it will be added to its
      appropriate part of the site. <strong>For now, nothing is fully complete besides this
      home page because I'm doing a major reworking of the platform on
      which this site is built.</strong> If you click on any of the links in the
      navigation above, you will see at least a landing page explaining
      the purpose of that area of the site. Feel free to reach out to me
      using any of the icons in the footer below if you have any questions,
      feedback, or suggestions.
