-Multiple shopping lists
-Ability to edit/reorder the list 
-ability to attach a price to an item on a list 
-adjustable quantities and calculation based on price
-3 different ways to mark a single item 
  1. On the list
  2. High lighted that I need to pick up that item
  3. Crossing the item off as put into my cart
(I like to keep a list of everything I buy at a given store, but
 I might not need to pick up everything on the list every time I go. 
 So the highlighting feature can be like a 3-way lightbulb: 
 dimmest setting shows every item on the list, middle setting checks 
 off what you need to get on the list, and a pale running total to 
 show the estimated amount of money you'll spend, and the highest 
 setting would have a darkened or boldly shown total to indicate 
 how much what is in your cart costs.)

-running tally calculated from that 3rd highlighted feature to 
 give me the total cost of purchase. 
-possible feature to click if I want total calculated with sales tax
-ability to sort lists into categories such as dry goods or produce
 or frozen foods. 
-ability to edit and change prices
-some apps I've seen have the ability to compare prices by the unit
 ($2/pound or $0.36/oz.) I'd like the ability to compare costs between
  lists of different stores (I.e.: does this cereal cost more or less at 
  Costco, can find it for cheaper at Walmart?)
-ability to email or send in messenger the list to someone else
 (husband offers to stop by the grocery store and asks what we need, 
 I send him that medium list that checks off what we need to get, not 
 everything I buy at a grocery store.) 
-customizable background settings, because grocery lists usually 
don't look like computers, and it helps with likability. 
-ability to "zoom out" to see that middle highlighted list without 
the prices so you can see at a glance the whole list, not just 5 items 
on the list.
